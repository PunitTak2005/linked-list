# linked-list
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored in a sequence. Each node contains two parts: the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as the nodes are not stored contiguously in memory.
