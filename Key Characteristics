Key Characteristics
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically, making them more flexible than arrays.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements is efficient, especially at the beginning or middle of the list, as it only requires updating pointers.
Non-Contiguous Storage: Nodes are stored in different memory locations, linked together by pointers.
